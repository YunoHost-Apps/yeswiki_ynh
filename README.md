## Overview

YesWiki is a wiki designed to remain simple, very easy to install, in French translated into English, Spanish, Catalan, Flemish...

However, with a YesWiki we can build a website with multiple uses:
- Gather all the information of a project or a group (function of "central station")
- Mapping members or places in a participatory way
- Share resources, lists, calendars thanks to powerful cooperative databases
- Communicate information flows
- Cultivate a bit of freedom...


**Shipped version:** 4.2.3~ynh1


**Demo:** https://ferme.yeswiki.net/?CreerSonWiki

## Disclaimers / important information

#### Multi-users support

LDAP integration is supported and required on new installs. It is possible to disable it on older installs by removing the loginldap plugin. **Warning: only do it if you know credentials for a wiki admin account**

At the moment SSO authentication is not supported. It is necessary to login on the wiki.
